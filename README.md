#              Python Facebook Bot
====================


### What is this?
----------------
  This is a Facebook Bot/Assistant, writen in Python and using Facebook API for some
  specific tasks.  
  At the moment, I only implement it some functions to crawl/get Facebook's events by
  location, since Facebook shutdown that APIs.  

### Installation
---------------
  To install python-facebook-bot, simply:
  ```
  pip install python-facebook-bot
  ```  

### What do I need? (requirements.txt)
------------------
  Right now, I'm only using **requests** for requesting APIs.  

### Where are the tests?
-----------------------
  Just run `python setup.py test`
